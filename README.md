# PowerSchool API for Node.js

A Node.js library for interacting with the PowerSchool SIS API.

We currently support fetching a variety of data on the user. Due to a lack of testing resources, we currently only support read operations. There are no API calls that modify user data or submit any information other than logging in.

## Installation

**Node 7.0.0 or later is required to use this package.**

To install using NPM, type: `npm install powerschool-api --save`

## Usage

The provided [Test script](test.js) actually provides a pretty good example of how you would log a user in and fetch data like their courses. Check it out for a quick getting started example.

## Documentation

To take full advantage of the package, check out [the documentation](https://aydenp.github.io/PowerSchool-API/) and see all of the methods and variables that are made available to you.
